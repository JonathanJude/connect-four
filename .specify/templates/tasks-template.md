# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Next.js Application**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root (per constitution)
- **Standard Structure**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`
- Paths shown below assume Next.js structure - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Create Next.js project structure with TypeScript
- [ ] T002 Install dependencies: React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] T004 [P] Set up TailwindCSS configuration and custom animations
- [ ] T005 Initialize PWA configuration (manifest.json, service worker)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [ ] T006 [P] Game logic tests in tests/unit/test-game-logic.ts
- [ ] T007 [P] AI algorithm tests in tests/unit/test-ai-algorithms.ts
- [ ] T008 [P] Component integration tests in tests/integration/test-game-components.tsx
- [ ] T009 [P] Accessibility tests in tests/accessibility/test-keyboard-navigation.ts
- [ ] T010 [P] Offline functionality tests in tests/integration/test-offline-capability.ts

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

- [ ] T011 [P] Game board logic in src/lib/game-logic.ts
- [ ] T012 [P] AI algorithms (3 difficulty levels) in src/lib/ai-algorithms.ts
- [ ] T013 [P] Game state management in src/context/GameContext.tsx
- [ ] T014 [P] Game board component in src/components/GameBoard.tsx
- [ ] T015 [P] AI player component in src/components/AIPlayer.tsx
- [ ] T016 [P] Game controls in src/components/GameControls.tsx
- [ ] T017 [P] localStorage persistence in src/lib/storage.ts
- [ ] T018 [P] Main game page in src/app/page.tsx

## Phase 3.4: Integration

- [ ] T019 [P] Connect game state to localStorage persistence
- [ ] T020 [P] Implement responsive design with TailwindCSS
- [ ] T021 [P] Add Tailwind animations for game interactions
- [ ] T022 [P] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] T023 [P] Add ARIA labels and screen reader support
- [ ] T024 [P] Configure PWA service worker for offline play
- [ ] T025 [P] Add dark/light theme toggle

## Phase 3.5: Polish

- [ ] T026 [P] Performance optimization tests
- [ ] T027 [P] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] T028 [P] Update JSDoc documentation for all components
- [ ] T029 [P] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] T030 [P] Vercel deployment configuration
- [ ] T031 [P] Add analytics for game statistics (localStorage-based)
- [ ] T032 [P] Future features roadmap documentation

## Dependencies

- Tests (T006-T010) before implementation (T011-T018)
- T011 blocks T012, T013
- T013 blocks T014-T018
- T017 blocks T019
- Implementation before integration (T019-T025)
- Integration before polish (T026-T032)

## Parallel Example

```
# Launch T006-T010 together:
Task: "Game logic tests in tests/unit/test-game-logic.ts"
Task: "AI algorithm tests in tests/unit/test-ai-algorithms.ts"
Task: "Component integration tests in tests/integration/test-game-components.tsx"
Task: "Accessibility tests in tests/accessibility/test-keyboard-navigation.ts"
Task: "Offline functionality tests in tests/integration/test-offline-capability.ts"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Game Requirements**:
   - Game logic → unit tests [P]
   - AI algorithms → algorithm tests [P]
   - User interactions → integration tests [P]

2. **From Constitution Requirements**:
   - Accessibility → accessibility tests [P]
   - Offline capability → offline tests [P]
   - Animations → animation implementation tasks

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each game flow → component tests [P]
   - Each user interaction → integration tests [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Core Logic → Components → Integration → Polish
   - TDD strictly enforced (tests before implementation)
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked by main() before returning_

- [ ] All game logic has corresponding tests
- [ ] Constitution requirements addressed (accessibility, offline, animations)
- [ ] All tests come before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [ ] TypeScript and React best practices followed
- [ ] TailwindCSS-only animations ensured
- [ ] PWA configuration included
