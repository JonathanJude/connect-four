# Feature Specification: Connect Four Web Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-complete`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a complete, user-focused specification for a modern, playful, offline-capable 'Connect Four' web game."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a casual or competitive player, I want to play Connect Four against an AI opponent with different difficulty levels, so I can enjoy quick games with satisfying visuals and review my playing history.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a new player, **When** I first visit the game, **Then** I see an empty board with clear instructions to start playing
2. **Given** I want to change difficulty, **When** I select a difficulty level, **Then** the AI behavior immediately reflects my choice
3. **Given** I am playing a game, **When** I click a column, **Then** my disc drops with smooth animation and it becomes the AI's turn
4. **Given** I win/lose/draw a game, **When** the game ends, **Then** I see a clear result message and can choose to play again
5. **Given** I want to review past games, **When** I open the history view, **Then** I see a list of completed games with metadata
6. **Given** I select a past game, **When** I open the replay viewer, **Then** I can step through each move or watch an auto-play replay
7. **Given** I refresh the page, **When** the game reloads, **Then** my in-progress game and settings are preserved
8. **Given** I prefer keyboard navigation, **When** I use arrow keys and enter, **Then** I can play the entire game without a mouse

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the board is full (draw game)?
- How does system handle invalid moves (full column)?
- What happens when user tries to navigate away during an active game?
- How does system handle browser storage being full or disabled?
- What happens when AI takes longer than expected to make a move?
- How does system handle network connectivity changes during offline play?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a 7�6 game board with interactive columns
- **FR-002**: System MUST support single player vs AI gameplay only
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide three AI difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow players to choose their disc color (red or yellow)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual feedback for valid/invalid move targets
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and announce win conditions (4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect and announce draw conditions (full board with no winner)
- **FR-008**: System MUST save game settings in local storage
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve in-progress games across page refreshes
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain a history of at least 50 completed games
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide move-by-move replay functionality for completed games
- **FR-012**: System MUST support keyboard-only gameplay
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide turn indicators and game status feedback
- **FR-014**: System MUST work fully offline after initial load
- **FR-015**: System MUST be installable as a Progressive Web App

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Game**: Represents a single game instance with board state, current player, move history, and game status
- **GameSettings**: Stores user preferences including difficulty level, preferred disc color, and theme settings
- **GameHistory**: Collection of completed games with metadata (timestamp, difficulty, result, duration, move count)
- **Move**: Individual game move containing player, column position, timestamp, and resulting board state
- **Player**: Game participant with associated disc color and move history
