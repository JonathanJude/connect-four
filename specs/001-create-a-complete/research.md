# Phase 0: Research & Analysis

## Research Findings

### Technology Stack Decisions

**Decision**: React 18+ with Next.js 14+ App Router + TypeScript 5.0+
**Rationale**:

- React provides the component-based architecture needed for game state management
- Next.js App Router offers optimal routing for game and history pages
- TypeScript ensures type safety for game logic and state management
- Constitution requirement compliance
  **Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Svelte, Angular (rejected due to constitution constraints)

**Decision**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
**Rationale**:

- TailwindCSS provides utility-first styling approach
- shadcn/ui offers accessible, customizable base components
- Constitution prohibits animation libraries like Framer Motion
- Enables modern, playful visual design requirements
  **Alternatives considered**: Styled Components, Emotion, Material-UI (rejected due to constitution)

**Decision**: localStorage + IndexedDB (browser native)
**Rationale**:

- Constitution requirement for browser native persistence
- localStorage for user settings and preferences
- IndexedDB for game history and state snapshots
- No external persistence libraries permitted
  **Alternatives considered**: Firebase, Supabase, localForage (rejected due to constitution)

### AI Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Three difficulty levels with different algorithms
**Rationale**:

- Easy: Random move selection with center bias
- Medium: Heuristic-based shallow minimax (depth 3)
- Hard: Full minimax with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening
- Constitution requirement for single-player vs AI gameplay
  **Alternatives considered**: Neural networks, Monte Carlo Tree Search (rejected as overkill)

### PWA Architecture

**Decision**: Next.js PWA with service worker
**Rationale**:

- Constitution requirement for offline-first architecture
- Next.js PWA plugin provides simplified configuration
- Service worker for caching static assets and offline functionality
- Vercel deployment compatibility
  **Alternatives considered**: Custom service worker, Workbox (Next.js PWA preferred)

### Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Async AI execution with time budgets
**Rationale**:

- <200ms response time requirement for hard difficulty
- requestIdleCallback/setTimeout for non-blocking AI moves
- Iterative deepening with time caps for hard difficulty
- UI responsiveness during AI thinking phase
  **Alternatives considered**: Web Workers (rejected due to complexity overhead)

### Accessibility Requirements

**Decision**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA support
**Rationale**:

- Constitution requirement for accessibility compliance
- Screen reader compatibility for game state announcements
- Keyboard-only gameplay support
- WCAG AA color contrast compliance
  **Alternatives considered**: Partial keyboard support (rejected as insufficient)

### Animation Implementation

**Decision**: TailwindCSS keyframes only
**Rationale**:

- Constitution prohibits animation libraries
- TailwindCSS provides sufficient animation capabilities
- Custom keyframes for disc drop, victory glow, hover effects
- Reduced motion variants for accessibility
  **Alternatives considered**: Framer Motion, CSS animations (Tailwind preferred per constitution)

## Unknowns Resolved

### 1. Browser Storage Limits

**Research Task**: IndexedDB storage limits and quota management
**Finding**: IndexedDB typically allows 50MB+ storage, sufficient for 50+ games with move history

### 2. AI Performance Requirements

**Research Task**: Minimax performance with JavaScript
**Finding**: With alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening, <200ms response achievable for depth 8

### 3. PWA Offline Capabilities

**Research Task**: Next.js PWA plugin capabilities
**Finding**: Next.js PWA provides comprehensive offline support with simple configuration

### 4. Screen Reader Game State Announcements

**Research Task**: ARIA live regions for game state
**Finding**: aria-live="polite" regions effectively announce game state changes

### 5. Mobile Touch Interactions

**Research Task**: Touch event handling for game board
**Finding**: Touch events work seamlessly with React event system for mobile gameplay

## Compliance Verification

All constitution requirements have been addressed:

- [x] React + Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- [x] TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui only
- [x] Browser native persistence
- [x] Three AI difficulty levels
- [x] Offline-first PWA architecture
- [x] TypeScript strict mode
- [x] Comprehensive documentation requirements
- [x] Accessibility compliance
- [x] Performance targets achievable

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Standard web technologies with well-established patterns
**Medium Risk**: AI algorithm performance optimization
**Low Risk**: Browser storage compatibility
**Low Risk**: PWA implementation with Next.js plugin

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- Create data model for game entities
- Design component architecture
- Generate API contracts (if applicable)
- Create quickstart documentation
- Update agent-specific context file
