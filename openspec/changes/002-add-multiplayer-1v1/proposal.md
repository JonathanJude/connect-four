# Change Proposal: Add 1v1 Multiplayer Mode

**Change ID**: `002-add-multiplayer-1v1`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft

## Why

The current Connect Four game only supports single-player mode where users play against an AI opponent. Users have requested the ability to play with friends and family on the same device, which would significantly expand the game's appeal and create more engaging social gameplay experiences while maintaining the offline-first approach.

## What Changes

- Add game mode selection between "Play vs Computer" and "Play vs Friend"
- Implement 1v1 multiplayer gameplay with two human players alternating turns
- Create multiplayer-specific UI components (setup dialog, turn indicators, victory messages)
- Extend game state management to support player names, colors, and multiplayer game flow
- Add multiplayer settings and preferences (default player names, color choices)
- Update game history and replay functionality to support multiplayer games
- Maintain full backward compatibility with existing single-player functionality

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: `game-core` (game logic and state management), `user-interface` (UI components and interactions)
- **Affected code**: Game state management, UI components, settings system, persistence layer
- **User experience**: Adds new game mode option while preserving existing functionality
- **Technical complexity**: Medium - extends existing architecture without breaking changes
- **Performance**: No significant impact expected
- **Dependencies**: None - remains fully offline-capable
