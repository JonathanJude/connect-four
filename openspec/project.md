## Project Conventions

### Code Style

- **Formatting**: Prettier with 100-character line width, single quotes, trailing commas, 2-space indentation
- **Naming**:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `GameBoard.tsx`, `SettingsDialog.tsx`)
  - Files: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for components
  - Variables/Functions: camelCase with descriptive names
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `BOARD_ROWS`, `AI_TIME_BUDGETS`)
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase with descriptive prefixes (e.g., `GameState`, `AIThinkingState`)
- **Imports**: Absolute imports using `@/` path mapping for clean module resolution
- **File Organization**: Feature-based structure with clear separation of concerns

### Architecture Patterns

- **Component Architecture**:
  - Functional components with React hooks
  - Custom hooks for business logic (`useGameState`, `useAI`, `useSettings`)
  - Context providers for global state (`SettingsContext`)
  - Compound component patterns for complex UI
- **State Management**:
  - React hooks and context for global state
  - Local component state for UI-specific concerns
  - Reducer pattern for complex state transitions
- **Data Flow**:
  - Unidirectional data flow
  - Props drilling minimized with context
  - Event handlers passed down, state lifted up
- **Type Safety**:
  - Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive type coverage
  - Domain-specific types and interfaces
  - Runtime validation for critical game state
- **Error Handling**:
  - Custom error classes with specific error codes
  - Graceful degradation for non-critical features
  - User-friendly error messages

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component and utility testing
- **Test Structure**: Tests organized in `/tests` directory with contract, integration, and unit subdirectories
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for game logic, components, and utilities
- **Test Types**:
  - Contract tests for game rules and AI behavior
  - Integration tests for component interactions
  - Unit tests for individual functions and components
- **Testing Philosophy**: Test behavior, not implementation details

### Git Workflow

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky runs lint-staged to ensure code quality
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript, React, and accessibility rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier runs on staged files before commit
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches with descriptive names
- **Commit Standards**: Clear, descriptive commit messages

## Domain Context

### Game Rules & Logic

- **Board**: 7 columns Ã— 6 rows grid-based game board
- **Objective**: Connect 4 discs in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- **Players**: Human vs AI (single-player) and Human vs Human (1v1 multiplayer)
- **Game Modes**: Single-player (vs AI) and offline 1v1 multiplayer (two humans on same device)
- **Disc Colors**: Red and Yellow (player-selectable, customizable per player in multiplayer)
- **Win Conditions**: 4 consecutive discs in any direction
- **Draw Condition**: Board full with no winner

### AI Implementation

- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (50ms), Medium (100ms), Hard (200ms) thinking time
- **Algorithm**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- **Performance Tracking**: Nodes evaluated, pruning efficiency, win rates
- **Responsive**: Non-blocking AI computation with progress indicators

### Game Features

- **Game Modes**: Single-player (Human vs AI) and offline 1v1 multiplayer (Human vs Human)
- **Player Management**: Customizable player names and disc colors in multiplayer mode
- **Persistence**: Local storage for game state, settings, and history (supports both game modes)
- **History**: Track up to 50 completed games with full replay capability (separate tracking per mode)
- **Replay System**: Step-by-step move playback with variable speed (works for both modes)
- **Animations**: Smooth disc dropping, winning line highlights, hover effects
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Business Rules

- **Offline-First**: No network dependency, fully client-side (applies to both game modes)
- **Data Retention**: Games and settings persist across browser sessions (supports both single-player and multiplayer)
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations, sub-200ms AI response times (AI performance applies to single-player mode only)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design (applies to both game modes)

## Important Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **Client-Side Only**: No backend services, all logic runs in browser
- **Storage Limitations**: Browser local storage capacity limits
- **Performance**: Must maintain 60fps during animations
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of game history and replay data

### Design Constraints

- **Responsive Design**: Must work on screens from 320px to 4K
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth animations without blocking UI
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios for disc colors

### Business Constraints

- **Offline Capability**: Must function without internet connection
- **Data Privacy**: No external data transmission or tracking
- **Performance Budget**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across devices and browsers

## External Dependencies
